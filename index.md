tagline: "Understanding forest ecosystems through the lens of insect population dynamics"
hero_description: |
  We combine field ecology, statistical modeling, and computational approaches to understand how insect populations shape forest ecosystems. Our research spans spatial dynamics, outbreak prediction, climate change impacts, and forest health assessment.

    <h2>Research Focus</h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>Our lab investigates the quantitative ecology of forest insects, with emphasis on understanding population dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. We develop and apply statistical and mathematical models to address fundamental questions in ecology while contributing to sustainable forest management.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>We believe that understanding complex ecological systems requires integrating multiple approaches. Our work combines long-term field monitoring, experimental manipulations, and quantitative modeling. We are committed to open science and reproducible research, sharing our data and code to advance the field.</p>
  
  <p>The lab is affiliated with the Department of Biology at [University Name] and collaborates with government agencies, forest industry partners, and international research networks.</p>
